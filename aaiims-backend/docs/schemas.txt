ok so we want to build a portal for farmers
first entity is farmers

mainly he will be adding products to the portal
and he will be getting paid after he sells the products
we can also give rating to farmers
farmers address will also be also useful
we also have to show how much he has sell to someone(mostly userId will be used to match them with eachother)

ok so should we start from scratch or continue the existing app;
